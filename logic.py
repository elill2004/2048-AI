# [Marking Scheme]
# Points to note:
# The way to do movement is compress -> merge -> compress again
# Basically if they can solve one side, and use transpose and reverse correctly they should
# be able to solve the entire thing just by flipping the matrix around
# No idea how to grade this one at the moment. I have it pegged to 8 (which gives you like,
# 2 per up/down/left/right?) But if you get one correct likely to get all correct so...
# Check the down one. Reverse/transpose if ordered wrongly will give you wrong result.
